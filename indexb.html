<h1>Hello and welcome to my page!</h1>

<p>My name is Michael B and this is my very first webpage. It was built using the HTML skills I learned at the Zero To Mastery Academy. You can learn more about the ZTM academy by clicking the link below.<br><br><a href="https://zerotomastery.io">Zero To Master Academy</a></p>



<p>I am still relatively new to building websites with HTML and programming with Python but so far I am having a lot of fun with both! I hope you will check back every so often to see how my skills are progressing!In the meantime please feel free to poke around the link below to learn more about me.</p>
