<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p>I was born in sunny Southern California in 1984 and I have three brothers; Matthew, Mark, and Chris. I graduated from Mission Viejo High School in 2002 and later attended the University of California, Irvine, where I earned a BA in Political Science. Additionally, I am two classes shy of completing an AA in Accounting from Orange Coast College.
<p>I like to spend my free time reading, riding one of my many bicycles, playing ice hockey, or going on road trips/traveling. One of my guilty pleasures is online gaming, mainly Warzone.</p>
